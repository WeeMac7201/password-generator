# WeeMac's Password Generator
A simple password generator using Python and the PyQt5 Framework.

The generator has some customisation options such as specifying the length and whether or not it should contain numbers/special characters. For convinience a copy to clipboard button is also available. 

I made this password generator as a small project in my Python Learning process. The code was made utilising the knowledge provided by BroCode on Youtube.
Chat GPT was used as a guiding tool to cover gaps in my knowledge which the Bro Code Series did not cover.
